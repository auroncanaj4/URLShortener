This is an web application using React as frontend library, Express for backend and MySQL database.

In order to run this project in your local machine, after you clone repository or download it into your local machine you run:

Just for the sake of getting to run it without issues I pushed the schema.db and .env files even though they are not recommended to get at any remote repository.

Frontend:

```cd ./client
    yarn
    yarn dev
```

Backend:

```cd ./server (from root path of the project)
    yarn
    yarn dev
```

In order to fully functionalize this project you need to have a MySQL database, which you can create through mysql command line, phpmyadmin or related options that you prefer.
